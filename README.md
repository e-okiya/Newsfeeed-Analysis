# Newsfeeed-Analysis

## Objective
The objective is to generate graphs that analyze users' interaction patterns with the 365 platform's Newsfeed service

## The Challenge
A newsfeed is a part of a website that constantly updates with new content, showing the latest news or activities. This feature facilitates real-time discoveries and encourages user engagement by presenting fresh content each time the user accesses the platform.
The 365 platform’s Newsfeed offers a mix of automated and manual posts. Automated entries showcase students’ milestones, such as completing an award card collection or earning a certificate of achievement. On the other hand, manual entries are texts created by students to share insights or opinions with the community.
The aim of this Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau project is to determine which type resonates more with our audience and identify potential issues with these features, along with suggestions for enhancements. The task is to create several visualizations giving crucial information about the newsfeed and how the users react to it.

## Findings
1.Regarding average likes per post, which post subtype is the least favored?

After examining all subtypes using the appropriate dashboard filter, it's evident that the Level-type and Collection-type posts are the least popular.

Collection: Out of of 9,376 posts 170 received likes
Level: Out of 22,313 posts, 422 received likes.
The notably low average of around 0.02 likes per post for both categories underscores this conclusion.

2.The Subtype Post Distribution graph indicates that the Level-type posts are the most prevalent, appearing 22,313 times, whereas the Career Track Certificate posts are the least frequent, with only 144 instances. The count is comparable to the second least common post subtype—the manual Text post, with 150 examples.

3.Refer to the Newsfeed User Engagement graph to determine the proportion of visitors who engaged with the newsfeed. By dividing the number of active users by the overall visitors and multiplying by 100, we get the engagement rate in percentage. Using this formula, 405 divided by 3956 yields an engagement rate of 10%.

4.Based on our observations, Level-type posts dominate the newsfeed, surpassing all other subtypes. Their total count is twice that of the runner-up, the Course Certificate post. Despite their frequency, the trend indicates that Level-type posts—alongside the Collection post subtype—generate minimal interest and seldom entice users to engage with likes.

This suggests that Level-type posts might be saturating the newsfeed with content users don't find compelling, thereby diminishing their overall experience with the feature. A wise strategy might be to reevaluate how these posts are generated and curtail their prevalence on the newsfeed. More engaging posts can take the forefront, potentially elevating user engagement and bolstering interest in the feature—ensuring more captivating posts remain visible rather than those with fewer likes.
